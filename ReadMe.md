PacMen Coding Assignment using JAVAScript

Description

Pacmen assignment is developed using two dimensional array which holds all the four images of pacMan that is needed to simulate the animation.
The function makeOne() is called when the 'Add PackMan' is clicked. makePack() is used to make a packMan at a random position with random velocity. update() loops over the packmen array and move each image in the DOM.

Installation

download all images including the index.html.

Usage

open the index.html file. You can click 'Add PackMan' button to add the packman images and then click on the 'Start Game' to animate the packmen to going around the page. It turns whenever it reaches the end of the page boarder.

RoadMap

Build it to the game where the player controls PacMan who travels inside a maze trying to eat all the dots while avoiding the colorful ghosts. This game only uses the one packman image and in future all four will be utilized depending on the position of the packman image.
